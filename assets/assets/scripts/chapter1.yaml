Little Oakdale:
  - zherrain: I sat atop the craggy hill, looking down on the sleepy town as snow fell peacefully. The twinkling street lamps and soft light of the candles burning within windows of the cosy houses came in and out of focus. Dressed in all black to camouflage against the night, my keen eyes skimmed the streets of Little Oakdale carefully. My name is Zherrain, and I'm an assassin. Even though on this particular occasion I had been hired to use my skills for a very different purpose; to save a life rather than take it away. I was looking for a young girl, a child of a wealthy merchant, who'd been missing for just over 2 days. Time is of the essence when searching for a missing person, as I knew very well. Most people think it's impossible for someone to just simply disappear, but if you know what you're doing it's all too easy. The child, a girl called Ciara, stood out around these parts. Her father, a man known as Girian, had shown me a recent likeness portrait so I had something to go on. Her hair was spun gold and very long, down to her waist. Her skin was fair, a stark contrast to the tanned, olive tones that were common around the Obsidian Peninsula. But the most telling of her features were her eyes. One was green, like an emerald in the sun, the other a dark violet, a sign of the magick. Girian had told me that she was last seen in the fields on his property, tending to her favourite cow. Ciara didn't have any friends, so spent most of her time with the animals on her father's farm. Her mother Ziriam was a flamboyant woman, and was always travelling around the Peninsula styling the hair of the noble women. Ciara had one sibling, a younger brother named Cathal. Cathal was 7 years younger than her, only 5 years old. Girian had begged me to bring his daughter back before his wife was due home, which was in little over a week. He had pleaded with me, his face streaked with tears and eyes full of sadness. The child is highly likely still alive, and chances are that her captors are looking for a ransom. Either that, or she's being sold as a slave. I knew of a gang of people servicing the Upper Kingdoms, who had more questionable morals than those of the Peninsula. Ciara could be anywhere if that were the case, as the dealings of the outlaw gang known as The Ebben Circle, were highly complex. Thankfully my reputation had bought me a lot of respect with the townsfolk who would definitely cooperate with me. Chances of Ciara being in Little Oakdale were slim, but informants were everywhere. I planned to be on The Ebben Road before dawn, armed with information critical for finding the child. Finally, I saw who I was looking for. A hooded man walked down the cobblestone streets, hunched over and heading towards the town square. I knew him to be Rennald, a scrupulous man with allegedly strong ties to The Ebben Circle, most likely to keep his own hide out of trouble. He reached the Town Hall, looked around carefully, then entered the building. I waited ten seconds, before descending into the town. The Town Hall was locked of course, but I knew how to get through a locked door with extreme ease. I entered the hall silently.

Town Hall:
  - narrator: The tall room was silent and dark, but for a soft glow underneath a door on the upper floor. I ascended the staircase and opened the door, which led into a kitchen. Rennald would be in a secret room, accessible at the back of the large kitchen, which gained one passage into the bowels of a castle. Little Oakdale was a minor town, but all towns on the Obsidian Peninsula had their own castle. Little Oakdale's was situated on a steep hill, far above the rest of the town. From the upper floors you can see the glistening Obsidian Ocean, a stunning view. The royal family was in disarray, even though the town seemed to operate just fine without their input, which was just as well as far as I was concerned. The floors creaked in multiple places, indicating that there was more than one person on this level. I moved quickly and silently around the kitchen, towards the back room. If Rennald wasn't alone, I'd like to see who he was liaising with. I climbed onto the strong ceiling beams, wanting to go unnoticed. Sometimes gaining true intel is easier if people don't know that you're there, and it is much more elegant than forcing it out of them. I maneuvered through a gap in the ceiling to enter the next room. I crept along the beam silently until two figures came into view. I strained to hear them as they spoke in low, hushed voices. Rennald was below conversing with a hooded figure of substantial height, someone I didn't recognise. He emanated a power I was not familiar with. Magic was becoming less and less common around here. I got as close to them as I dared and crouched down as low as I could.
    type: thought
  - rennald: ... but why now? The girl's presence here has been common knowledge for YEARS. She's not any kind of threat. Girian, as big a fool as he is, has done a good job so far.
  - narrator: Rennald seemed exasperated, sweat glistening on his forehead despite the cold.
    type: thought
  - unknown: That doesn't matter. Her powers are growing by the day. Soon enough she'll know how to use them.
  - rennald: Why does that matter?
  - narrator: The hooded figure sighed.
    type: thought
  - unknown: Eon believes her to be not only of magical blood.
  - narrator: Rennald's eyes widened. 
    type: thought
  - rennald: No. She can't be. The Oracle tells us the time of the next Aurfairene isn't for another thousand years. It's a mistake I tell you, the child is born of magicka and that's it! The Aurfairene must meet certain criteria.
  - narrator:  Rennald looked smug at his knowledge.
    type: thought
  - rennald: They must have elven ancestry, among other things.
  - unknown: Oh but she isn't just born of magic.
  - narrator: The hooded figure looked up at the ceiling in my general direction, unnerving me.
    type: thought
  - unknown: The Oracle has more information. The child is indeed of elven ancestry.
  - rennald: IMPOSSIBLE!
  - unknown: Very possible. But before long, as the prophecy spreads, more people will be after her. For example, the assassin now knows everything I just told you.
  - narrator: he said with a smirk.
    type: thought
  - narrator: The colour drained from Rennald’s face, visible even under the dim light of the candle.
    type: thought
  - rennald: The assassin? Zherrain?!
  - narrator: He spun around, scanning the room.
  - narrator: I usually easily go unnoticed. The fact that this man was privy to my presence proved that he is of magicka himself.

  - rennald: WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MURDERER?!
  - narrator: Rennald tried to hide his fright with a demand.
    type: thought
  - zherrain: Same thing as you by the sounds of it. I'm after the child, what do you know?
  - narrator: I laced my voice with persuasion magic, which seemed to be rebutted by the hooded figure. I frowned at him.
    type: thought
  - unknown: Assassin, the child is none of your concern.
  - narrator: Said the figure, who lowered his hood around his shoulders.
    type: thought
  - narrator: I studied his face, which was one I did not recognise.
    type: thought
  - narrator: He was young and handsome, his eyes were violet, and he had a scar running down the side of his face.
  - unknown: I suggest you leave this business be, and get back to what you know.
  # CHOICE
  - zherrain: I was hired to complete a job, and I plan to see it through.
  - narrator: We glowered at each other, each sizing the other up.
    type: thought
  - narrator: Rennald looked at each of us before screeching angrily
    type: thought
  - rennald: Oh, get over yourselves you two!
  - narrator: He eyed me suspiciously.
    type: thought
  - rennald: Who hired you?
  - zherrain: I should be the one asking questions, not the other way around.
  - narrator: I hissed at him. Rennald rolled his eyes and turned away, muttering something about never liking me.
    type: thought
  - unknown: We may actually have use for you and your skills, assassin. Seeing as you insist on being part of this.
  - narrator: The violet-eyed man stood taller.
    type: thought
  - unknown: Were you hired by Girian the merchant?
  - narrator: I raised my eyebrows, although I was not that surprised. This man seemed to be a learned one, skilled in magical arts. A sorcerer or perhaps a witch doctor, neither of which I thought much of despite being born of magic myself.
    type: thought
  - zherrain: I'll answer your questions, but first tell me this. Who are you?
  - narrator: The young man studied my face, before quietly answering.
    type: thought
  - narora: My name is Narora, I hail from Uryn. An Aishro apprentice of Einslo The Rushed.
  - zherrain: An Aishro, in these parts?
  - narrator: I laughed.
    type: thought
  - zherrain: You don't look much like a warrior.
  - narrator: Narora narrowed his eyes.
    type: thought
  - narora: I don't care what I look like devna’ar.
  - narrator: He ran his hand through his thick, dark hair.
  - narrator: I knew an insult when I heard one. I drew my dagger, brandishing it threateningly as I approached Narora.
    type: thought
  - zherrain: It matters little to me who or what you are, no one calls me names and lives, Aishro.
  - narrator: I sensed a power emanating from Narora, and I stopped.
    type: thought
  - narora: You're born of magic, AND you're a sensitive?
  - narrator: Narora laughed.
    type: thought
  - narora: You will be of great use to us, She'uron.
  - narrator: I hadn't heard that word in a long time. I sheath my weapon, more curious than ever about Narora.
    type: thought
  - zherrain: Why do you want this Ciara girl?
  - narrator: I asked inquisitively.
    type: thought
  - zherrain: What is an Aurfairene? And finally, how do YOU fit into this mess?
  - narrator: Narora looked at Rennald, before looking back at me with an enigmatic smile.
    type: thought
  - narora: Meet us at the tavern tomorrow morning, 7 of Morn. Come alone, and say nothing to the merchant.
  - zherrain: But I'm supposed to be on my way to the Ebben Road by then.
  - narrator: I complained.
    type: thought
  - narora: You'll never find her going that way. If you're thinking that The Ebben Circle is behind her disappearance, then you'd be wrong.
  - narrator: I was baffled.
    type: thought
  - narrator: Narora continued
    type: thought
  - narora: The Tavern, 7 sharp. If you don't show then you'll never see us again, and you'll never find Ciara.
  - narrator: He smiled.
    type: thought
  - narora: So assassin, are you in or out?
  - narrator: Before I could answer, both men disappeared before my eyes.

# The Tavern:
#   - narrator: At roughly 7 Morn I walked through the doors of The Greedy Goblin Tavern, the only bar in town. At this time there’s never too much activity, but there are always some of the drunks left over from the night before. This morning, there was a barmaid and another woman, presumably the drunk man’s wife, trying to wrestle a drunkard out the door. I stood aside as they pushed and pulled him toward the entrance, and he resisted and complained. I looked around the large room. Despite its size, it had a homely feel to it. Sun was streaming through the large windows situated on the east side of the room, and towards the western side there were lanterns illuminating the space. The bar was next to a large staircase leading to the upper floor, and across the bar there were barrels of alcohol and discarded glasses. Light fixtures holding burning torches could be found around the walls throughout the tavern - most not yet extinguished from the night time hours - which made the whole place seem overbright. Above the bar, not surprisingly, was a stuffed and mounted goblin head. His expression was that of annoyance, making him seem perpetually irritated with the position in which he had found himself in. Either that or he was just over the antics of the patrons. Can’t say I’d blame him honestly. As I walked through the tavern, I tried to behave as innocently as possible, keen not to draw attention to myself. I scanned the faces of those in the room. There was a lady frantically counting her money and talking to herself, a few older gents quietly drinking coffee on a table near the bar and two hooded figures in the back corner. I felt power emanating from the figures, an enchantment spell to keep attention off of themselves. I stared at them, and one gestured frantically for me to come over.
#     type: thought
#   - unknown: What’s wrong with you? Just pull up a chair and sit down!
#   - zherrain: one of the hoods hissed, clearly Narora.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: I told you to come at 7 Morn SHARP! It’s 7:06.
#   - narrator: I looked at him as I sat down.
#     type: thought
#   - zherrain: Alright, calm down.
#   - narora: Look. We have a very limited time frame to work with here. I have somewhere to be, things to organise. Minutes could mean the difference between catching up with Ciara’s captors or losing her completely. You’re lucky we’re even still here. And for Thivara’s sake, cloak yourself! We don’t want to draw any unwanted attention.
#   - zherrain: I didn’t realise you were this uptight,
#   - narrator: I laughed as I imbued myself with cloaking magic.
#     type: thought
#   - zherrain: You didn’t seem the type yesterday.
#   - narrator: Narora glowered at me.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: Do you realise how ridiculous you sound? This isn’t a game, nor should it be taken lightly.
#   - narrator: He looked around the room suspiciously.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: At this hour, no one is suspecting anything, Narora. So let’s just relax and get to business, shall we?
#   - narrator: Narora whipped his head around.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: No one suspects anything, do they?
#   - narrator: he narrowed his eyes.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: Everyone suspects things. Spies are everywhere. Taverns are a place for information to be sourced.
#   - zherrain: Then why ask to meet up here?
#   - narora: Oh for the love of Grenessia, we don’t live around here so there IS nowhere else, I’m staying on the upper floors of this noisy, sleepless tavern so this was our best bet.
#   - zherrain: What about Rennald’s house?
#   - narrator: We looked at him.
#     type: thought
#   - narrator: Rennald snapped out of his trance upon hearing his name, and looked up.
#     type: thought
#   - rennald: Oh, oh um, no, m-my house isn’t a good place.
#   - narrator: he crossed his arms and shook his head.
#     type: thought
#   - rennald: Nope. Libna has her hands full with the twins and doesn’t like strangers in the house, much less dangerous ones such as the likes of yourselves. And Narora, I’d also appreciate it if you didn’t tempt the gods, not in times like this.
#   - narora: Tempt the…
#   - narrator: Narora groaned and rolled his eyes.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: The minor Gods scarcely concern themselves with what we say, they’re too busy worrying about their own dealings.
#   - rennald: Just… just to be on the safe side then, shall we?
#   - narrator: he looked around nervously.
#     type: thought
#   - rennald: Can never be too careful.
#   - narora: Whatever. Okay She’uron, listen up.
#   - narrator: Narora lowered his voice and leaned in.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: The girl, Ciara. She’s not just a regular Little Oakdalian citizen. Girian and that woman, Ziriam, they’re not her real parents. She’s from Irizhian, the Fair West.
#   - zherrain: The Fair West?!
#   - narrator: My eyes widened.
#     type: thought
#   - zherrain: That isn't possible.
#   - narora: Keep it down, would you? This information was never meant to get out. My job is to prevent that from happening. I was also supposed to be gone by now and you weren’t meant to get involved either. But unfortunately I realised your presence too late and had no choice but to let you in on these dealings.
#   - narrator: he rested his head in his hands.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: However,
#   - narrator: he looked up and continued.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: Having you with us might not be such a bad thing. Your sensitivity to magic, as well as your command of it, may be quite useful.
#   - narrator: I was still recovering from the revelation of Ciara’s origins. I wanted to know more than ever what she was.
#     type: thought
#   - zherrain: How did the girl get here?
#   - narora: Well there’s a few theories but even our oracle is unable to see the truth. One is that she was sent by the gods, even perhaps the Most High, to save our lands from the impending war.
#   - narrator: My jaw dropped.
#     type: thought
#   - zherrain: War? What war?
#   - narora: SHOOSH, dev’nar!
#   - narrator: he hissed again.
#     type: thought
#   - zherrain: How can I be quiet, are you serious? And whatever that damned word means, stop calling me a dev’narr.
#   - narora: It's only a foretelling.
#   - narrator: Narora shrugged.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: Also, that word is perfectly fitting for you.
#   - narrator: he smiled for the first time that morning.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: It means idiot in Nuician, but a refined idiot.
#   - zherrain: Oh sweet Avalessa, is it even possible for you to be more annoying? So if the Ebben Circle isn’t behind Ciara’s disappearance then who is?
#   - narora: We could test that. And something much worse than the EC, we’re guessing.
#   - narrator: Narora looked graven.
#     type: thought
#   - narora: I don’t know how much you’ve been told about The Deep, the seas and lands beyond the calm waters of the Obsidian Ocean?
